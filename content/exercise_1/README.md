# Data Minded Academy - Introduction to Linux & Bash
## Exercise 1 - Navigation in the system

In this exercise you will have to use the classic navigation commands. The tasks are the following:

0. Check your current location with an appropriate tool.
1. Run `source messthisthingup.sh` . This script will take at a random place of the machine and make your terminal a bit less self-explainable.
2. Determine where you currently are.
3. How many files are there? What are they?
4. Run `ls -la`. What are those information about?
5. Find your way back to the folder where you ran the first script.
6. Run `source imback.sh` script to restore your terminal status.

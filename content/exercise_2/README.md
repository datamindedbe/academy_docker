# Data Minded Academy - Introduction to Linux & Bash
## Exercise 2 - Files manipulation & globbing

In this exercise you will have to use the Linux files manipulation commands (and globbing patterns). The tasks are the following:

1. Generate the exercise by running `./generate_exercise.sh`. This will create you two folders: landing_area and structured_area. You can inspect what's going on there by running the `tree` command.
2. Sort the raw files of the landing_area folder inside the structure of the structured_area folder by using the least amount of commands possible. To do so, help yourself with globbing.
3. Keep the commands you used in step 2 and compose a script that automates the processing of the landing_area. Try your script on a new environment.

Note: If you need to restart your exercise, you can run the `./cleanup.sh` script followed by the `./generate_exercise.sh` script again.

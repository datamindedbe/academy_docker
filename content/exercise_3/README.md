In this exercise you will have to use the redirection and pipe operators in conjonction with some basic commands. The tasks are the following:

1. Run the `ls â€“al /bin/` . What is this command doing ?
2. Use the `head` and `tail` commands in coordination with the pipe ( | ) operator to retrieve the 10th result starting from the top and the 10th result starting from the bottom.
3. Write the two results to the same file `output.log` by using redirection and concatenation operators
4. Write a small script made of the commands you built before.

This repository is hosting the exercises provided to students in the context of the `Containerization with Docker` course of the Data Minded Academy.

## 1. The exercises in details

The following exercises are part of the repository:

* **Exercise 1 (`exercise_1`) - Learn to move around**: In this exercise, students are asked to:
    * Run the `source messthisthingup.sh` script. The latter will customize the $PS1 variable to hide all the information of the terminal and bring students somewhere random in the system.
    * Determine where they currently are.
    * Say how many files are there. What are they? (`ls -1 | wc -l`)
    * Run `ls -la`. What are those information about?
    * Find their way back to the folder where they ran the first script to run the `source imback.sh` script.
